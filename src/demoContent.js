Davi (keyboard, bass, guitar, xylophone, cavaquinho), Geoff (vocals, guitar, bass), Latisha (violin), and Renee (vocals, accordion, percussion, guitar, piano) bring together their diverse musical heritage to create original songs. The band began its roots with Davi and Geoff getting together to jam. Latisha then joined in, adding the soft harmonies of the violin. However, the crew was not complete until the addition of Renee. Her unique voice, imaginative songs, and pure creativity, as well as her past experiences as a professional musician, helped to organize the group, and point them in the right direction. The group's foundation started in Knoxville, TN at the Preservation Pub where they performed surrounded by friends and fans for an enthusiastic crowd. In the end, what started out as a group of friend's playing music in the guys' front living room, resulted in this original debut cd titled, sample AB-11-26. Enjoy.",
